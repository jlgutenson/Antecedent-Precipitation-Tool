This whole package was originally just a script I wrote so that I didn't have to perform
the painstaking task of using web-browsers, excel sheets, and massive amounts of human labor 
to follow USACE's old protocols for determining the normalcy of Antecedent Precipitation,
as they were written in the April 2000 ERDC Technical Note by Sprecher and Warne and as 
demonstrated for me by Mr. James Robb.  Jamie deserves much of the credit for this work,
as he not only taught me the protocol the long and painful way, but he also put the idea of
automating part of the process in my head in the first place.  As a biologist, with no training
whatsoever in programming, I never expected this to be used by anyone other than Jamie and myself.
Over time, the tool was shared with a few other interested parties, and through Jamie's legendary
networking skills, it came to the attention to a great number of people.  I wrote the
original version of this tool largely at home, on my personal time.  After all, who would pay
a biologist to write code?  However, once the utility of this package became clear, I was
eventually permitted to spend significant amounts of work time maintaining it.  Now that it
has become a joint property with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, there has been no shortage
of compromises (ahem, compulsary ULA acceptance every launch), but I will remain eternally
grateful for the incredibe support the Corps and its management have provided me, especially
with regard to the recent act of allowing me to spend a great deal of time improving ease of
use and the clarity of the methodology for members of the public.  I apologize in advance to
any career-programmers who may be harmed by the reading of this speghetti code, or its
the comments for which alternate between excessive and absent.  I have a great deal of respect 
for the profession, and I hope to one day join your ranks in earnest.  As it stands, I feel
silly claiming to be the author of this software, as it, like many open-source Python
projects, stands on the shoulders of giants.  With this in mind that I could not resit the
urge to write this little message nor could I resist the urge to hide it in the open-source
license document, where it will likely never be read by anyone.

Enormous thanks to the creators of the "Ulmo" package for getting me started
pulling data from NCDC.  I barely knew how to script ArcMap when I started 
this project, and I doubt I would have made much progress without the initial
leg up from this module. Contributers include: Erek Alper,
Francesc Alted, Bryan Anderson, Cameron Bracken, Tim Cera, Cédric David,
Anthony Ford, Jiří Kadlec, Victor Klepikovskiy, Nikolay Koldunov,
Emilio Mayorga, Tyler McEwen, Solomon Negusse, Dharhas Pothina, rockg,
Colin Talbert, and Andy Wilson.
